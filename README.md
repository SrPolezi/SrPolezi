# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile. 
## My name is Luiz Eduardo and my nickname is "SrPolezi"


### Since 2022 I've been rediscovering myself with Delphi and since then it's been a better learning experience than the other, each new feature delivered is a victory for me, I'm extremely detailed and I always try to use good practices to raise my level in programming even more.
